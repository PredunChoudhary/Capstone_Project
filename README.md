# Nutrical-analysis-capstone-project
1.Introduction : In this project we have to extract meaningful information from the McDonalds menu nutritional dataset. and we have to perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends. using Visualization we have to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items. and also we have to identify the healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content . I have carried out this analysis using various python library like pandas, matplotlib,seaborn,numpy.

2.Problem Statement : McDonald's is a global fast-food chain known for its diverse menu offerings. As a data analyst, our task is to analyze the nutritional content of the menu items available at McDonald's outlets. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items.

3.Objectives:

Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.
Analysing and Understanding Data
5.Handle missing values and data cleaning

6.Import necessory libraries

7.Checking duplicate values

8.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) And Data Visualization:

•Analyze the distribution of calorie counts across menu items.

•Explore the nutritional content (e.g., fat, protein, carbohydrates) of different items.

•Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

•Create bar charts, histograms, and box plots to visualize calorie distribution and nutritional content.

•Compare nutritional characteristics of different food categories (e.g., burgers, salads, desserts).
